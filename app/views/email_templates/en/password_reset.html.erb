<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
  Someone (hopefully you) has requested a password reset for the email address
  <code><%= email_address %></code>.
</p>

<p>
  To reset your password, click the link below.
</p>

<%= helpers.button[reset_link, "Reset password"] %>

<p>
  If the above link does not work, copy and paste the following link into your
  browser:

  <a href="<%= reset_link %>"><%= reset_link %></a>
</p>

<p>
  This password reset link will expire in one hour.
</p>

<p>
  If you did not request this password reset, you can ignore this email.
</p>

<p>
  Have a great day!
</p>
